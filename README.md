## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Atom text editor


### What I learned

I learned to prevent a background image from overflowing outside of its parent using the "overflow" property. It took me a few tries to figure that one out.



### Continued development

I still don't feel I have enough control over the background circles and how they behave when the screen changes size. I will focus on responsiveness on the next project.
